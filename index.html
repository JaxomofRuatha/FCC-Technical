      SAS is a powerful data analysis suite that takes practically any data source and processes
      it through coded steps into a form where anaytics and reporting can come to insightful conclusions.

      <h1>Program Steps</h1>
    </header>
    <p>
      Programs in SAS contain two types of steps:
      <ol>
        <li>
          DATA step - allows for reading or writing data, manipulating the data, and performing
          calculations.
        </li>
        <li>
          PROC step - prompts SAS to run procedures to perform certain functions, including
          producing reports, summaries, and visualizations of data.
        </li>
      </ol>
      There are also global statements in SAS, which persist throughout the current environment and
      between steps. Every statement must end in a semicolon to be valid.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are only two data types in SAS: character and numeric. These are stored in 8 bytes
      unless specified by the coder otherwise.

      A DATA step will start with the word <code>data</code> and end with a statement of <code>run;</code>.
      A PROC step will start with the word <code>proc</code> and also end with <code>run;</code>. Good practice
      is to proceed any step that produces output with the word <code>title</code> to create a global statement
      labeling the data for readability. Within these steps, some of the additional statement keywords include:
      <ul>
        <li><code>infile</code> - this statement will direct SAS to where data values are coming from</li>
        <li><code>input</code> - will process the raw data from the <code>infile</code> as determined
        by the format given (more in the <a href = "#Input_and_Formatting">Input and Formatting</a> section).</li>
      </ul>

      SAS is divided into several different windows, each providing a specific portion of the current
      environment. These are divided up as follows:
      <ul>
        <li>Code - This is where you will write the code to be executed by SAS. It has a "Submit"
          button to allow you to run the code.
        </li>
        <li>Output - This window will show the results of running the parts of your code intended to
          generate output.
        </li>
        <li>Log - This window displays the dataflow and any error or warning messages resulting from
          the running of your program, as well as any technical details like processing time.
        </li>
        <li>Explorer - 
        </li>
      </ul>
