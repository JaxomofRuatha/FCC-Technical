      SAS is a powerful data analysis suite that takes practically any data source and processes
      it through coded steps into a form where anaytics and reporting can come to insightful conclusions.

  <section class = "main-section" id = "Program_Steps">

      <h1>Program Steps</h1>
    </header>
    <p>
      Programs in SAS contain two types of steps:
      <ol>
        <li>
          DATA step - allows for reading or writing data, manipulating the data, and performing
          calculations.
        </li>
        <li>
          PROC step - prompts SAS to run procedures to perform certain functions, including
          producing reports, summaries, and visualizations of data.
        </li>
      </ol>
      There are also global statements in SAS, which persist throughout the current environment and
      between steps. Every statement must end in a semicolon to be valid.
    </p>

    </header>
    <p>
      There are only two data types in SAS: character and numeric. These are stored in 8 bytes
      unless specified by the coder otherwise.

      A DATA step will start with the word <code>data</code> and end with a statement of <code>run;</code>.
      A PROC step will start with the word <code>proc</code> and also end with <code>run;</code>. Good practice
      is to proceed any step that produces output with the word <code>title</code> to create a global statement
      labeling the data for readability. Within these steps, some of the additional statement keywords include:
      <ul>
        <li><code>INFILE</code> - this statement will direct SAS to where data values are coming from</li>
        <li><code>INPUT</code> - will process the raw data from the <code>infile</code> as determined
        by the format given (more in the <a href = "#Input_and_Formatting">Input and Formatting</a> section).</li>
        <li><code>DATALINES</code> - signals SAS to begin reading the data on the next line.</li>
        <li><code>LENGTH</code> - used before <code>INPUT</code> statement to dictate maximum length of variable name. Ex: <code>LENGTH [variable] $12</code> creates variable with maximum length of 12.</li>
        <li><code>SET</code> - statement used to copy a data set.</li>
        <li><code>IF</code> - statement used to filter data, only keeping observations meeting the conditions specified.</li>
        <li><code>LIBNAME</code> - defines the creation of a new library (takes definitions for name and directory)</li>
        <li><code>LABEL</code> - defines a data set label, which is displayed in certain outputs.</li>
        <li><code>COMMENT</code> - keyword can be used to denote a strictly comment statement. This can
        also be done using <code>*;</code> and <code>/*  */</code></li>
      </ul>
    </p>

      <h1>Windowing Environment</h1>
    </header>
    <p>
      SAS is divided into several different windows, each providing a specific portion of the current
      environment. These are divided up as follows:
      <ul>
        <li>Code - This is where you will write the code to be executed by SAS. It has a "Submit"
          button to allow you to run the code.
        </li>
        <li>Output - This window will show the results of running the parts of your code intended to
          generate output.
        </li>
        <li>Log - This window displays the dataflow and any error or warning messages resulting from
          the running of your program, as well as any technical details like processing time.
        </li>
        <li>Explorer - This section allows for exploring of libraries and system directories containing
          data sets and file trees.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
  </section>
    <section class = "main-section" id = "Input_and_Formatting">
    <header>
      <h1>Input and Formatting</h1>
    </header>
    <p>
      By default, the infile will be read and parsed based on blanks as a delimeter of data inputs. This
      can be changed to several different options depending on the type of infile being used and original
      formatting of the data to be read.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section class = "main-section" id = "Libraries">
    <header>
      <h1>Libraries</h1>
    </header>
    <p>
      Libraries show up under the "Libraries" folder within the Explorer window. You can reference a
      data set within a library using the notation <code>[LIBRARYNAME].[DATASETNAME]</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      There are two different types of libraries in SAS: WORK and PERMANENT. The WORK library is
      a temporary library with all the working data sets, and will be deleted after the program is closed.
      The remaining libraries are part of the PERMANENT library, and will be saved after closing.

    <p>
      <code>PROC Export</code> - allows to export SAS data file into an external file like an Excel
      spreadsheet or text file. This statement takes 4 arguments:
      <ol>
        <li><code>DATA</code> - selects the data set to use for exporting.</li>
        <li><code>OUTFILE</code> - determines the file path that will be created when exporting.</li>
        <li><code>REPLACE</code> - option to overwrite the exporting file if it already exists
        on the stated path (recommended to always use).</li>
        <li><code>DBMS</code> - specifies the file type for the export (Ex: <code>xls</code> for
        Excel spreadsheet).</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>PROC Print</code> - prints variables for observations in a data set, with no options will
      print all of each, but has options to filter what prints in the report.
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>PROC Contents</code> - Creates a description of the data set instead of the data values.
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>PROC Datasets</code> - Generates a detailed listing of the members of a data library.
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>PROC Options</code> - Lists the current SAS system settings, takes arguments to make changes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>PROC Means</code> - Provides descriptive statistics for numeric variables in a data set.
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>PROC Transpose</code> - Restructures values for output, turning selected variables into
      observations.
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>PROC SQL</code> - Allows for the usage of SQL query language in obtaining filtered portions
      of a data set or modifying/creating data sets.
