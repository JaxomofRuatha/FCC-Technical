      SAS is a powerful data analysis suite that takes practically any data source and processes
      it through coded steps into a form where anaytics and reporting can come to insightful conclusions.

    <p>
      Programs in SAS contain two types of steps:
      <ol>
        <li>
          DATA step - allows for reading or writing data, manipulating the data, and performing
          calculations.
        </li>
        <li>
          PROC step - prompts SAS to run procedures to perform certain functions, including
          producing reports, summaries, and visualizations of data.
        </li>
      </ol>
